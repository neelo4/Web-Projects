Subject: VDI Latency Issues Impact Report - Ticket #[Insert Ticket Number]

Dear Jayson,

I'm writing to provide details about the significant VDI latency issues I experienced today that severely impacted my work productivity. Here are the specific challenges I encountered:

1. Complete system unresponsiveness with pages failing to load
2. Multiple unexpected VDI session disconnections requiring reconnection
3. Persistent authentication failures requiring multiple login attempts

These technical difficulties have resulted in:
- Substantial work interruptions and lost productivity
- Delayed response times to urgent tasks
- Missed portions of scheduled meetings due to connectivity issues
- Extended time spent on basic tasks due to system performance

To address these issues, I've raised IT ticket #[Insert Ticket Number] and am currently awaiting a Citrix hard refresh. The total estimated time lost due to these technical difficulties is approximately [X] hours.

Could you please help expedite this matter given its significant impact on daily operations and project deadlines?
