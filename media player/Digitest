Subject: Request for Additional Testing Time Due to Technical Delays

Team,

I wanted to update everyone about our current testing timeline and request additional time due to several challenges we've encountered today:

Current Challenges:
1. Deployment delays have caused the status to remain in queue
2. VDI performance issues (slow speed) have impacted our progress
3. These delays have prevented QA from completing all test scenarios

Additional Consideration:
- After unit test cases are completed and approved, we'll need to merge the branch to master
- This will require another round of QA validation

Given these circumstances, we would appreciate additional time for the QA team to ensure thorough testing coverage.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this timeline adjustment.

Thanks for your understanding,
[Your name]
