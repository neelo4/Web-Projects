Ah, in that case, here's a more appropriate message for your group chat since you've already begun development:

"Hi team, I'm currently developing the edocs feature and have a question regarding the implementation. The Figma design shows Option 5 (Designer Recommended) which includes brand-aligned styling, consent section, merged subcopy in heading, and text link changes. Since I've started working on this, wanted to quickly confirm if we're sticking with Option 5 to ensure I'm on the right track and avoid any rework. Can someone please verify?"

This message:
1. States that development is in progress
2. Highlights the specific design option you're working with
3. Shows urgency since work has begun
4. Asks for quick verification to avoid potential rework

Would this better capture your current situation? Let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything to make it more specific to your progress point.
